                    <h4>Consistency is key!</h4>
                    <p>Learning to code your own web app is a challenge similar to learning a new language. It's important to practice the new skills you are developing. And just like learning a new language, daily applicaiton will help solidify all the new things you are exploring.</p>

                <div class="advice-two">
                    <h4>Can I get some help?</h4>
                    <p>As you progress in your new endeavor, at times you will get stuck. It's important not to get discouraged - remember, this happens to everyone! The coding community has many great resources and groups online. Don't be afraid to ask for assistance in tackling a problem.</p>

                <div class="advice-three">
                    <h4>You can do it!</h4>
                    <p>Once you get comfortable pushing the boundaries of your own understanding, you will begin to enjoy the challenge. As your coding skills improve you will transition from seeing what's happening, to understanding the underlying structure. As you begin to develop more complex and immersive applications, have fun and be sure to reward your hard work!</p>
